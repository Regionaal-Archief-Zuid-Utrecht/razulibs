    "### Class ```S3Storage```\n",
    "\n",
    "This class uses boto3, the official Python SDK for AWS to interact with the S3 storage. It wraps aws api calls into class methods, adding needed parameters, exception handling and whatever other additional features are needed. It provides methods for interacting with an S3-compatible storage service. \n",
    "\n",
    "The subclass EDepot, combines these S3 'basic' services to implement ad hoc e-depot pipelines. \n",
    "\n",
    "It includes functionalities to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check or create a bucket\n",
    "- Upload files with metadata\n",
    "- List objects in a bucket\n",
    "- Retrieve file metadata\n",
    "- Verify the integrity of uploads using MD5 checksums\n",
    "- Update and retrieve access control lists (ACLs) of objects\n",
    "- Retrieve the bucket policy\n",
    "- Check and retrieve block public access settings\n",
    "\n",
    "The class initializes an S3 client using credentials (endpoint, access key, and secret key) retrieved from environment variables. The credentials should be stored in a `.env` file. Lookup order for `.env` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The current working directory (so different projects/buckets can use their own creds)\n",
    "2) Fallback to the module directory (this file's directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: On my client \"sudo hwclock -s\" is sometimes required (when clock is 'skewed')\n",
    "\n",
    "N.B. When passing the object key as argument, it is always \"nl-wbdrazu/k50907905/689/001/067/nl-wbdrazu-k50907905-689-1067806.extension\", not just the last part.\n",

    "    *Issues*:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "```check_or_create_bucket```: Checks if a bucket exists in the S3 storage and creates it if it does not exist. Takes in input a bucket name and a boolean to enamble versioning. True if the bucket exists or was created successfully, False if an error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "*this is two tasks and when true is returned you don't know if bucket existed or was created. There's a message printed, so maybe this is not a problem. I guess the logic here is: I want to make a bucket, I don't need to know if it exists already but the back end needs to make sure if the bucket already exists it is not created again.**I wonder what is the use of this function? I want to create a bucket, then maybe if the bucket already exisats we want to return something else than ture, like 'choose another name etc'**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Also Why is enable_bucket_versioning False by default? If versioning is set as True, the function calls another method 'set_bucket_versioning' wich is by default set as 'Enabled' status. But **There is no confirmation of setting the versioning**.*\n",

    "*ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. For single uploads, it is usually the md5 checksum. For bigger files, different md5 are computed for each part. that is why the functions tries to capture that and if it's the case downloads the file and recalculate md5. [s3 data integrity](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/data-integrity-s3) this might be useful, to read. The etag might not necessarily be the md5* \n",

To know more about what different control levels entail see [s3 ACL overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html). The default 'public-read'means that ALL USERS get READ permission (s3:ListBucket, s3:ListBucketVersions, and s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads\ts3:GetObject and s3:GetObjectVersion), and OWNER gets FULL_CONTROL (the combination of all permissions READ,. WRITE, READ_ACP, WRITE_ACP)|* \n",
